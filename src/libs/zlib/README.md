Please get zlib from its source at https://zlib.net/ or through your favourite package manager.

If you are on Windows, you may have to compile it manually:
1. From the link above, acquire the source (either download a release or clone the repository)
1. From this directory, run `windows.bat` and enter the path to the `zlib` source code from step 1
1. Make sure to read the last line of output from the script
